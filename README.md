# My Homelab



## 📝 Overview
Welcome to my homelab repository! This project serves a dual purpose: it's both a learning platform and a practical solution for home automation and services. Through this homelab, I'm actively exploring and implementing modern DevOps practices, specifically focusing on:

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Implementing continuous integration and deployment workflows
- **GitOps Methodologies**: Managing infrastructure and application configurations as code
- **Internal Services**: Hosting and managing various applications that enhance my home environment

This repository documents my journey, configurations, and the evolution of my homelab infrastructure. Whether you're a fellow homelab enthusiast or just curious about self-hosted solutions, you'll find detailed documentation about my setup and the services I maintain.

> 🎯 **Primary Goals**:
> - Learn and implement industry-standard DevOps practices
> - Maintain a reliable infrastructure for home services
> - Document and share knowledge with the homelab community
